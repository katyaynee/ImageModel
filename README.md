# ImageModel
## Dependencies
To use ImageAI in your application developments, you must have installed the following dependencies before you install ImageAI :

Python 3.7.1 (and later versions)

Tensorflow 1.4.0 (and later versions)

OpenCV

Keras 2.x

pip install -U tensorflow keras opencv-python

## Installation

pip3 install imageai --upgrade

ImageAI provides 4 different algorithms and model types to perform image prediction. To perform image prediction on any picture, take the following simple steps. The 4 algorithms provided for image prediction include SqueezeNet, ResNet, InceptionV3 and DenseNet. Each of these algorithms have individual model files which you must use depending on the choice of your algorithm. To download the model file for your choice of algorithm, click on any of the links below:

SqueezeNet (Size = 4.82 mb, fastest prediction time and moderate accuracy)

ResNet50 by Microsoft Research (Size = 98 mb, fast prediction time and high accuracy)

InceptionV3 by Google Brain team (Size = 91.6 mb, slow prediction time and higher accuracy)

DenseNet121 by Facebook AI Research (Size = 31.6 mb, slower prediction time and highest accuracy)
